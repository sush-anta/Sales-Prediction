# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting product sales using machine learning techniques based on historical sales data. The goal is to build a model that helps businesses optimize marketing strategies for sales growth.

## Objectives

- Develop a machine learning model to predict sales trends.
- Analyze various factors affecting sales, such as:
  - Advertising spend
  - Promotions
  - Customer segmentation
- Handle data preprocessing tasks:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature scaling
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate analysis techniques.
- Deliver a structured GitHub repository with clear documentation on approach and methodology.

## Expected Outcome

A predictive model that assists businesses in making informed decisions to enhance sales performance by optimizing marketing strategies.
